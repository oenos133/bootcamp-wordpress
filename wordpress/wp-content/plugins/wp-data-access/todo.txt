*** BUGS ***

+ After updating a table design the user (sometimes) has to reconcile to reflect the real database table structure
+ Recreate repository not working as expected on WordPress multisite
+ Cannot not use Screen Options for child tables when having more than one child tabs
+ Data Project pages not editable when a remote host is down (solution: use ajax to fill listboxes; does this apply to other plugin pages as well?)
+ When you perform a reconcile, your lookup database/table combinations are messed up (Amy)
+ After adding new parent the child tab is not directly shown (Sebastian)
+ Hyperlinks Behaviour â€“ Unexpected behaviour in Data Projects (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/hyperlinks-behaviour-unexpected-behaviour-in-data-projects/)
+ Fix Data Backups
+ Shortcode wpdadiehard:
  The date format: in Wordpress my date format is d.m.Y. When i use this to enter date data, in first attempt the date will be turned around; when i correct it,
  in the second attempt it is correct. By now i have solved it by using the format YYYY-mm-dd to enter data but i would prefer to use the other format. (Barbara)
